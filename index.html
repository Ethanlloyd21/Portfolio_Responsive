                Hello! I am a full-stack web developer from Seattle, Washington. 
                I have a diverse set of skills, ranging from design, to HTML + CSS + Javascript, all the way to PHP. 
                I specialize in using Java and Python to build customer facing APIs, bringing the best experience to the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I am not coding I am travelling. Travelling helps open my mind. I realize that there's no one way to live life. 
                Meeting people from other places shows that the world view is not the same as everyone else. 
                The different setting helps me discover and consider fresh ideas I hadn't thought before. By being 
                exposed to new places, people and cultures, I developed a wider view of the world.
